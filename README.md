This repository contains a C++ implementation of an AVL Tree data structure, along with a main driver program for testing and demonstration. The AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Files Included:

main.cpp: Main driver code to test the AVL Tree implementation.
AVL.h: Header file defining the AVL Tree class and its public methods.
AVL.cpp: Source file implementing the AVL Tree functions, including balancing and rotation logic.
test.cpp: Additional test cases or helper functions to validate AVL Tree operations.

Features:

Self-Balancing Tree: Keeps the tree height-balanced for faster operations.
Rotations: Implements left, right, left-right, and right-left rotations for balance.
Efficiency: Suitable for applications requiring dynamic, balanced datasets.# AVL-Tree-Project
